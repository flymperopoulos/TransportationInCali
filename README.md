**Context**
For our final project in Data Vizualization for the Fall 2015 section we developed a vizualization using transportation data collected from the State of California between the years 2000 and 2010. One can find the relevant data here: http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010

**Local use:**  
1. `npm install sqlite3`  
2. `npm install express`
3. `node apps.js` 
4. `node index.js`

Steps 1 and 2 setup your environment. Step 3 creates the db file and, finally, step 4 runs a local server on your machine.
